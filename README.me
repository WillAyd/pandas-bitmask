# Pandas Mask

This library implements a mask that can be used by the pandas library instead of a NumPy array. This project implements a suitable mask by using the nanoarrow library. Custom algorithms and conversions to NumPy are provided, where needed, to ease a potential transition for pandas from a byte-mask to a bitmask.
